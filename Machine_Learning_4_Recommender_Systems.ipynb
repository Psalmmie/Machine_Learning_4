    "Keras is a python library made for easily designing complex models such as deep learning models, in this module we are going to use just a few features from it to implement our simple matrix factorization model, as it makes a good introduction to the library before the next module about deep learning where you will also be using Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following function `get_mf_model` implements the model described in equation (2) in Koren's paper (without the $+\\lambda(\\ldots)$ part for the moment). So it basically tries to find the $p_u \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ and $q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ vectors that minimizes the squared loss between their dot product $p_u^Tq_i$, and the observed ratings $r_{ui}$, from random initialization of $p_u$ and $q_i$. In machine learning terms, $p_u$ and $q_i$ are called the *embeddings* of the user $u$ and of the movie $i$ respectively. Their size $k$ is an hyper-parameter of the model, which is called the *rank* of the factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, it uses the functional API from Keras (the other API proposed is the sequential one, but is not adapted for this model), you can read about it here : https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras, unlike Numpy, uses a different progamming paradigm. Numpy uses an *imperative* programming style (like python in general), meaning that when you execute `x.dot(y)`, the dot product is actually calculated. Keras however, uses a *declarative* (also called *symbolic*) programming style, meaning that when you write `Dot()([x, y])`, you tell Keras than when you will call the *fit* function of your model in the future, you will want to do a dot product between the future values that *x* and *y* will have. And this is what Keras is about, it allows you to build your own model as a sequence of operations, describing each input and output, and then later fit it and predict with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's not get in too many details, but retain that the `get_mf_model` function below is not actually executing the model, it creates it, and returns an object of the class `keras.models.Model` that has been instructed with your model operations, and this object can then be trained with the classic `fit` and `predict` functions. \n",

    "Each of the keras objects we defined in our model is called a *layer*, and we find them in order in the first column. The *Param #* column gives the number of trainable parameters of the layer, in our case these are just the embeddings, and they should be equal to $nb\\_users \\times k$ and $nb\\_movies \\times k$. The *Connected to* column tells for each layer which layers are inputs for this layer (you can safely ignore the `[0][0]` for this module).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the *Output Shape* column gives us the shape of the layer, each layer being a *tensor*. A tensor is the generalization of matrices to more than two dimensions. So a matrix is a 2D-tensor and a vector is a 1D-tensor, and each layer can be a matrix, a vector, or a higher-order tensor. The output shape we see is indeed the expected one at each layer, except there is this `None` in first dimension, why is that ?\n",

    "To understand it, we have to get into how Keras is actually minimizing the mean squared loss of our model. In general, when in comes to minimizing error functions on big datasets, a generic method is to use Stocastic Gradient Descent (SGD), briefly described in page 4 of Koren's article. \n",

    "This is what Keras does when it fits the model, it initializes the $q_i$ and $p_u$ embedding vectors randomly, and then perform mini-batch SGD to find the minimum mean squared error on the training set. Since mini-batching means considering multiple training samples at the same time, Keras keeps the first dimension of each layer to stack the samples of each batch, this is why `None` is written, the actual batch_size being set at training time when calling the `fit` function. This is also why we had to set `axes=1` when calling the `Dot` layer in the `get_mf_model` function, because the first dimension (axe 0) of each layer is kept for the batches. And about the `optimizer='adam'`, it is just a variation of mini-batch SGD that is faster, we'll get into more details about SGD variations in the optional parts of this notebook."
